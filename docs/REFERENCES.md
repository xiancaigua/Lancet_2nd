# Algorithm References

`rl-garden` reimplements published RL/IL algorithms in a shared PyTorch framework.
This page lists, for every registered algorithm, the paper it implements and the
reference implementation(s) it was ported from or cross-checked against. Sources
are taken from each algorithm's own module docstring
(`rl_garden/algorithms/<name>.py`); see that file for exact line-level formula
citations where the port involved a non-obvious translation.

Three categories appear below:

- **Ported** — code structure/formulas translated directly from a named external
  reference implementation.
- **Reimplemented from paper** — rl-garden's own implementation of a published
  algorithm, written from the paper and cross-checked against one or more
  external references (no single reference was translated line-by-line).
- **rl-garden extension** — new capability (action chunking, recurrence,
  DDP, off2on wiring, ...) layered on top of an already-listed algorithm; no
  separate external port.

External reference repositories are vendored read-only under `3rd_party/` (see
`.gitmodules` and each subdirectory's own `README`/`LICENSE`) except where noted
as "not vendored" — those were consulted during development but are not part of
this repository.

The following are not separate algorithms but are cited in multiple algorithms'
docstrings above and are rl-garden's own framework code, not ports:
`OffPolicyAlgorithm`/`OnPolicyAlgorithm`/`OfflineRLAlgorithm` (base training
loops), `Off2OnReplayMixin` (generic offline→online transition machinery),
`ChunkedReplayBuffer`/`_chunked_rollout.py` (generalizes [QC](https://github.com/ColinQiyangLi/qc)'s
single-env action-chunk queue to GPU-batched, per-env-staggered rollout).
