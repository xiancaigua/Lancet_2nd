"""Next-action tracking for Cal-QL's SARSA/FQE reference-value network.

Extends ``MCReplayBufferMixin`` with the dataset's actual next-step action,
needed to fit a reference Q-network via SARSA/TD regression instead of
Monte-Carlo return-to-go -- Cal-QL's own fix (paper Appendix D) for
continuing tasks like D4RL locomotion, where MC return-to-go is
truncation-biased near every artificial ``timeouts`` cutoff (see
``MCReplayBufferMixin`` and ``rl_garden.buffers.d4rl_legacy_dataset``'s
locomotion-family ``RuntimeWarning``).

This mirrors ``ReBRACReplayBuffer``'s next-action index-shift
(``rl_garden.buffers.rebrac_replay_buffer``), but adds the one guard that
pattern lacks and does not need for its own use case: an explicit
``next_action_valid`` mask, ``False`` wherever the shift would spill into
the following episode. ReBRAC relies on downstream ``(1-dones)`` masking at
true terminals, which is safe there; it is not safe here; because
locomotion's ``dones`` (TD mask) is terminations-only and almost always 0,
a naive shift would silently read the next episode's first action at every
~1000-step ``timeouts`` boundary.
