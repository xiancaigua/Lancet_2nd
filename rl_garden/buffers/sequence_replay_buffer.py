"""``SequenceReplayBuffer``: unified ``(T, N)`` windowed replay buffer,
sampling ``(window_len, B)`` windows, that both TD-MPC2's strict single-
episode windows and the R2D2-style recurrent/transformer buffers' tolerant
(boundary-masked) windows are built from -- model-based-base plan 1.6,
merging the former ``rl_garden.buffers.episode_slice_buffer`` module
(strict single-episode-window buffer + its sampling mixin, both deleted) and
the former ``_CheckpointedSequenceReplayBuffer`` scaffold (also deleted --
its storage/checkpoint/priority machinery lives here now) into one class,
selected at construction time by ``cross_episode``:

- ``cross_episode=False`` (**strict**, TD-MPC2): any candidate window whose
  ``[t0, t0 + horizon]`` span isn't fully contiguous within one episode is
  rejected outright (rejection sampling, see ``StrictWindowSamplingMixin``).
  No checkpoint grid, no priority tree.
- ``cross_episode=True, priority=True`` (**tolerant**, ``RecurrentReplayBuffer``/
  ``TransformerReplayBuffer``): an episode boundary *inside* the window is
  fine (masked downstream via ``episode_starts``/n-step reward zeroing,
  ``RecurrentSamplingMixin``); only a genuine ring-buffer-wraparound read is
  rejected. Windows are proposed by a priority sum-tree over a sparse
  ``stride``-periodic checkpoint grid.
- ``cross_episode=True, priority=False`` (**uniform**, DreamerV3, model-based-
  base Part 2 / plan section D): windows are drawn uniformly (no priority
  tree, no checkpoint grid) over every ring-buffer-contiguous
  ``[t0, t0 + horizon]`` span; an episode boundary inside the window is fine
  (masked downstream via the per-step ``is_first`` this mode stores, not
  ``episode_starts``). Every step's model recurrent carry (e.g. an RSSM's
  ``deter``/``stoch``) is stored densely (one slot per position, via
  ``carry_spec``) and written back after training (``write_back_carry()``) so
  the next sample of the same slots warm-starts from an up-to-date posterior
  instead of ``initial_state()`` -- see ``DreamerSequenceBatch``.

``priority`` (2026-09-14, revised from "derived from ``cross_episode``" --
see git history for the prior text) is now an independent constructor
argument: ``cross_episode=False`` always implies ``priority=False`` (strict
mode has no priority tree), but ``cross_episode=True`` supports either
``priority=True`` (the tolerant mode above, unchanged) or ``priority=False``
(the new uniform mode above). ``cross_episode=False, priority=True`` is not
implemented (raises ``ValueError``).

``RecurrentReplayBuffer``/``TransformerReplayBuffer`` stay thin subclasses of
this class for the tolerant path (their public constructor args and
``sample()`` outputs are unchanged, see those modules); TD-MPC2's online
buffer is this class used **directly** with ``cross_episode=False`` (no
subclass -- ``StrictWindowSamplingMixin`` gives it everything ``add()``/
``sample()`` need, plus the tail-step fix below).

**Tail-step fix** (model-based-base plan 1.6, scratchpad
``tdmpc2-upstream-vs-port.md`` section 3): a strict-mode ring buffer relies
on gymnasium vector-env autoreset to write the *next* episode's reset
observation into the storage slot immediately after an episode's last
transition -- so, before this fix, any window needing that slot (i.e. one
ending exactly at an episode's true final transition) was unconditionally
rejected, systematically under-sampling the last ``horizon`` steps of every
episode relative to the interior (upstream's per-episode-block storage has
no such loss). This class fixes it the same way ``FinalObsTableMixin``
already fixes the identical aliasing problem for the tolerant path: every
``add()`` call stores the true post-action observation into a compact
final-obs side table keyed by episode-end position (regardless of
``cross_episode``), and strict-mode's extended ``_valid_window_batch``
additionally accepts (instead of rejecting) a window whose last position
lands exactly on a recorded episode end, patching that position's
observation in from the side table (``_patch_tail_final_obs``) rather than
reading the ring buffer's aliased next-episode slot. ``StrictWindowSamplingMixin``
itself is NOT changed to do this -- it stays the original, side-table-free
rejection logic, still used verbatim by ``MmapMultitaskEpisodeBuffer``
(offline, pre-loaded whole episodes; no online autoreset aliasing exists
there in the first place, so the fix does not apply and is out of scope for
that host, see that module's docstring).
