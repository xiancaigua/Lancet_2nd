"""Shared observation-encoder resolution for algorithms.

This module is the Layer C entry point of the observation redesign (see
``.agents``/plan docs): it turns an algorithm's declarative
``encoder_config``/``obs_groups``/``critic_encoder_config`` attributes into
built encoder(s) via the Layer B factory
(``rl_garden.encoders.build_observation_encoder``), and exposes the actor/
critic encoder-sharing convention every algorithm needs
(``EncoderSharing``).

``ObservationEncoderMixin`` is meant to sit on ``BaseAlgorithm`` (see
``rl_garden/algorithms/base_algorithm.py``): every algorithm inherits the
``encoder_sharing`` class attribute and the ``_resolve_observation_encoders``/
``_policy_extractor_kwargs`` helpers for free, at zero constructor-signature
cost. ``_policy_extractor_kwargs`` returns the
``{"actor_extractor", "critic_extractor", "encoder_sharing"}`` kwargs an
algorithm's ``_setup_model`` passes straight into its ``BasePolicy``
subclass (see ``rl_garden.policies.base.BasePolicy`` for the actor/critic
extractor contract and stop-gradient rule those feed). Concrete algorithms
opt in by accepting ``encoder_config``/``obs_groups``/``critic_encoder_config``
constructor kwargs themselves (see ``SAC`` for the reference implementation)
-- these are *not* threaded through ``BaseAlgorithm.__init__``/
``OffPolicyAlgorithm.__init__``/etc., matching the existing convention where
observation-related kwargs live on the concrete algorithm class, not the
shared training-loop base classes.
