"""SACFlow: SAC with a flow-matching actor instead of a Gaussian actor.

Ports RLinf's SACFlow (`RLinf/rlinf/models/embodiment/flow_policy/`)
into rl-garden's SAC hierarchy. RLinf's actor loss is verified identical to
plain SAC's -- `alpha*log_pi - Q`, unmodified
(`RLinf/rlinf/workers/actor/fsdp_sac_policy_worker.py:524`) -- so
this subclass only swaps the actor network (`FlowMatchingActor`, see
`rl_garden/networks/flow_actor.py`) via `_build_policy`. `SACCore` (critic
loss, target Q, actor loss, alpha tuning, train loop) is inherited from `SAC`
unmodified, same shape as `SequenceSAC` swapping in a recurrent actor.

Box observations, and Dict/RGBD observations via a CNN-based (non-ViT)
``CombinedExtractor`` (`SAC`'s own vision pipeline, inherited unmodified), are
supported. A raw ViT token extractor is rejected below -- it installs a
structured features extractor (`structured_feature_config() is not None`)
that `FlowMatchingActor` (a plain features_dim-generic MLP trunk) has not
been verified against; that combination is out of scope for this port,
mirroring `SequenceSAC._build_policy`'s own guard shape.
