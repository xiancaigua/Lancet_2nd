"""DAgger (Ross et al. 2011): interactive imitation learning via a
beta-mixed scripted-expert rollout that always labels the aggregated dataset
with the expert's action, alternated with BC-style retraining.

Composes two existing, unmodified pieces rather than introducing new
machinery: ``BC`` (``algorithms/bc.py``, policy/loss/vision-dispatch
machinery, reused as-is) and ``DemoInterventionMixin``
(``buffers/demo_intervention.py``, the incrementally-growing buffer HIL-SERL
already uses for human-intervention data, reused here for expert-labeled
data instead). See ``.agents/local/imitation-learning-expansion-dagger-notes.md``
for the design rationale and comparison against ``HumanCompatibleAI/imitation``'s
own DAgger implementation.

``DemoInterventionMixin`` must come first in the MRO (``DAgger(DemoInterventionMixin,
BC)``, matching ``RLPDHybrid(DemoInterventionMixin, RLPD)``'s existing
precedent): ``BC._sample_train_batch(self)`` (no ``batch_size`` arg) is the
only such signature in this codebase -- every other algorithm, including
``PriorDataReplayMixin._sample_train_batch(self, batch_size)`` (inherited via
this mixin), takes the batch size explicitly. With ``BC`` first, its no-arg
override would shadow the mixin's mixing logic entirely and this would
silently degrade into "always sample the permanently-empty online buffer."
``train()`` below is therefore a near-copy of ``BC.train()`` that calls
``self._sample_train_batch(self.batch_size)`` explicitly, matching the
convention every non-BC algorithm in this codebase already uses.

``PriorDataReplayMixin._build_prior_data_buffer`` hardcodes ``num_envs=1``
(built for a static single-stream offline dataset) and, in its n-step
branches, reads ``self.nstep`` (only ever set by the SAC family -- ``BC``
has no such attribute). DAgger overrides it below to use
``num_envs=self.num_envs`` (rollout steps a real, possibly multi-env VecEnv
every round) and drops the n-step branches entirely -- DAgger has no n-step
return machinery, so ``self.nstep`` is never read.
