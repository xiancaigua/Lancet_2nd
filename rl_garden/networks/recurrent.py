# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE(future-work): why SAC / off-policy is NOT wired to this module (yet)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module is deliberately usable both for a single rollout step and for a
# full (T, B, D) BPTT window (see `step()` / `forward_sequence()` below), and
# nothing about its forward-pass API is PPO-specific. The reason only PPO
# consumes it this round is entirely on the *buffer/sampling* side, not here:
#
# PPO is on-policy: `train()` runs immediately after `RolloutBuffer.add()`
# finishes collecting a window, under (approximately) the same policy
# parameters that produced the data. That lets `RolloutBuffer.get_sequences()`
# always reconstruct BPTT windows starting from the TRUE hidden state that was
# live at collection time (captured once per rollout, masked at episode
# boundaries -- see PPO._setup_model()/train()) with zero staleness. No
# stored per-timestep hidden state, no burn-in, no padding.
#
# SAC (and any off-policy algorithm) breaks that assumption: replay sampling
# draws a WINDOW that starts at an arbitrary point in the buffer, not the true
# start of collection, and by the time it's replayed the policy/critic
# parameters have moved since that data was collected. A hidden state
# recomputed from a zero-init at the sampled window's start does NOT match
# what the CURRENT network would have produced walking in from the actual
# episode start -- it's simply the wrong conditioning state, and the
# mismatch compounds with off-policy staleness.
#
# R2D2 (Kapturowski et al., "Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed
# Reinforcement Learning", ICLR 2019) is the reference fix, and it combines
# TWO mechanisms -- their own ablation shows either one alone underperforms:
#   1. Store the RNN hidden state produced at collection time alongside each
#      stored transition/sequence-start, so replay has a real starting point
#      instead of a zero-init.
#   2. Burn-in: before the actual loss/BPTT window, re-unroll the RNN under
#      CURRENT parameters over a preceding window of transitions (no gradient
#      through the burn-in portion) so the hidden state entering the loss
#      window is freshly computed by today's weights rather than stale from
#      collection time. Stored-state seeds the burn-in; it is not used
#      directly as the loss-window's initial state.
#
# Concretely, wiring this module into SAC (or DDPG, or any replay-based
# algorithm here) requires THREE things this round does not build:
#   (a) Replay buffer storage for a hidden state per transition or per
#       sequence-start. `rl_garden/buffers/replay_buffer.py` and
#       `nstep_buffer.py` currently store only flat per-transition fields
#       (obs/next_obs/actions/rewards/dones) with no slot for auxiliary
#       per-timestep state.
#   (b) A sequence-aware sampler. `ReplayBuffer.sample()` (see
#       `replay_buffer.py::sample()`) draws fully IID
#       `(batch_inds, env_inds)` pairs via `torch.randint(...)` for both
#       axes -- no contiguity guarantee between consecutive samples at all.
#       An R2D2-style sampler needs to draw a contiguous
#       (burn_in_len + loss_len, ...) block per sample, anchored so the
#       stored hidden state at the block's start is valid.
#   (c) A burn-in-aware unroll mode on THIS module: something like
#       `forward_sequence(latent, state, episode_starts, burn_in_len=...)`
#       that runs the first `burn_in_len` steps under `torch.no_grad()` (or
#       with gradients detached) purely to refresh `state`, then continues
#       the remaining steps normally with gradients enabled for the loss.
#       Today's `forward_sequence()` has no burn-in concept and assumes its
#       caller's `state` argument is already the correct, un-stale starting
#       point -- true for PPO's own-collection-then-immediate-update
#       pattern, not for replay.
#
# None of the above exists yet anywhere in the repo. Do not assume
# `forward_sequence()` is replay-safe just because the shapes line up.
