"""Batched skill-macro-action wrapper for GPU-vectorized, SAME_STEP-autoreset
envs -- SUPE's online half.

``action`` (the input to ``step()``) has shape ``(num_envs, skill_dim)``: one
skill held fixed across ``horizon`` raw sub-steps while ``decoder`` (OPAL's
frozen decoder, ``OPALVAE.decoder`` -- a ``UnsquashedGaussianActor``, already
shipped) produces a fresh raw action from ``(obs_t, skill)`` at each
sub-step. Same batched-heterogeneous-termination handling as
``ActionChunkWrapper`` (``action_chunk.py`` -- see its docstring for the
accepted post-autoreset tradeoff: a terminated slot keeps receiving decoded
actions for the rest of the chunk, unavoidable under SAME_STEP autoreset,
but the returned macro-transition's reward/final-obs are unaffected), reusing
the same ``_tree_where`` helper. The one structural difference from
``ActionChunkWrapper`` is this wrapper decodes each sub-step's action itself
from the *current* observation, rather than consuming a pre-computed chunk
from the caller.

``deterministic`` is fixed at construction: False selects a stochastic
decode (``decoder.action_log_prob``'s rsample+clamp path), True a
deterministic one (``decoder.deterministic_action``'s mean+clamp path).
Upstream SUPE's own online rollout (``MetaPolicyActionWrapper.step()``,
``SUPE/supe/wrappers/meta_env_wrapper.py:104-118``) always calls the
stochastic ``sample_skill_actions`` -- for *both* its train and eval
instances (``train_finetuning_supe.py:185-203``); its own ``eval`` flag
only toggles reward-discount handling, never action determinism. The
deterministic path (``eval_skill_actions``, ``opal.py:454-460``) exists
upstream but is used only by OPAL's own standalone pretraining eval loop,
never by SUPE's online rollout -- so ``rl_garden/training/online/supe.py``
constructs both the train and eval wrapper with ``deterministic=False``,
matching upstream exactly. This parameter stays available as a general
capability of the wrapper, not because SUPE's own pipeline uses ``True``.

State-only: ``features = concat(obs["state"], skill)`` assumes a
``Dict({"state": Box})`` observation (rl-garden's observation contract for
every state-only backend), matching every other algorithm's state-only
scope.

Deliberate simplification vs. upstream: ``MetaPolicyActionWrapper`` isn't
actually a clean one-fresh-rollout-per-``step()`` wrapper -- it keeps a
persistent sliding observation/action window *across* ``step()`` calls
(``meta_env_wrapper.py:177-182``), so a mid-horizon termination can return a
transition whose actions mix the previous and current skill. That
"interpolated" path is gated behind ``FLAGS.interpolate``, which is off by
default with the code's own comment "Not used for any experiments in the
paper" (``train_finetuning_supe.py:43,330``) -- so this wrapper's simpler,
stateless-per-call semantics matches upstream's actual paper-reported
behavior in every case that matters, and a persistent single-instance
sliding window wouldn't vectorize across a batched env anyway.
