"""Wraps an rl-garden policy to satisfy RLinf's embodied model protocol.

Registers a new RLinf model type (``"rl_garden_ppo"``) via ``register_model``
(``RLinf/rlinf/models/__init__.py`` -- a real, public, mutation-
based extension point, not a source edit) so ``EmbodiedFSDPActor`` and
``MultiStepRolloutWorker`` can build this model through RLinf's own
``get_model()`` dispatch, exactly like RLinf's own ``MLPPolicy``
(``RLinf/rlinf/models/embodiment/mlp_policy/mlp_policy.py``, the
concrete reference this wrapper's ``default_forward``/``predict_action_batch``
shape was built against).

Unlike Phase 1/2 (``offline_actor.py``, ``sac_actor.py``, ``sac_rollout.py``),
which bypass RLinf's FSDP/model-registry machinery entirely, this Phase 3
adapter deliberately goes through it: ``RLGardenPPOFSDPActor``
(``ppo_actor.py``) subclasses ``EmbodiedFSDPActor`` to reuse its FSDP-aware
training loop rather than reimplementing it. The consequence, accepted
explicitly (see ``docs/design/rlinf-integration.md``, Phase 3): RLinf's own
generic ``compute_ppo_actor_loss``/``compute_ppo_critic_loss``
(``rlinf/algorithms/losses.py``) drive training, not
``rl_garden.algorithms.ppo.PPO``'s own ``train()``. This wrapper contributes
only network architecture -- an rl-garden policy's actor/value networks --
never the algorithm's update loop.

Never references ``PPOPolicy`` by name outside the ``_POLICIES`` registry
below (mirrors ``sac_actor.py``'s ``_ALGORITHMS``/``resolve_algorithm``
pattern): this wrapper is written against a duck-typed contract -- "the PPO
contract, network layer" -- requiring only
``act_with_value_and_logprob``/``evaluate_actions(..., sum_dims=False)``/
``predict``/``predict_values``, not any concrete policy class. A future
policy on the same contract (e.g. a ``SequencePPO``-family policy) needs
only a ``_POLICIES`` entry, not a wrapper change -- per
``docs/design/rlinf-integration.md``'s "adapters target the hook contract"
acceptance criterion, applied one layer below algorithm selection.
