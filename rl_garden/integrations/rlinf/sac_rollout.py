"""RLinf async SAC rollout adapter.

Selects actions for the live ManiSkill env using an rl-garden ``SACPolicy``
instead of RLinf's own ``get_model()``-dispatched models. See
``docs/design/rlinf-integration.md``, "SACCore contract (SAC, RLPD)".

Unlike the actor (``sac_actor.py``, a lightweight ``Worker`` subclass that
avoids RLinf's FSDP-actor base entirely), this **does** subclass RLinf's
``AsyncMultiStepRolloutWorker``: there is no FSDP anywhere in the rollout
path (it holds a plain ``nn.Module``), and its real content -- the channel
wire-protocol with the env worker (``recv_from``/``send_to``,
``PolicyOutput`` construction, pipeline-stage looping, weight-sync receive)
-- is exactly the machinery this adapter wants for free. Only two methods
are overridden: ``init_worker`` (build an rl-garden policy instead of
calling RLinf's model registry) and ``predict`` (call that policy directly
instead of going through ``SupportedModel``-dispatched
``predict_action_batch``, so ``cfg.actor.model.model_type`` never needs to
claim to be an RLinf model).

RLinf is optional: this module is importable without it (the class exists
with an ``object`` fallback base), but instantiating
``RLGardenSACRollout`` requires it.
