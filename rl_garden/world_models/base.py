"""``WorldModel``: the abstract base every model-based algorithm's learned
dynamics model implements, shared across decision-time-planning models
(TD-MPC2's latent-consistency model, ``rl_garden.world_models
.latent_consistency.LatentConsistencyModel``) and imagination-based models
(DreamerV3's RSSM, a future consumer -- see ``rl_garden.world_models.imagine``
and the model-based-base plan's Part 2).

Vocabulary, shared across the three concrete "what does the model predict"
families this base is designed to fit (see the model-based-base plan and
scratchpad ``dreamer-code-survey.md`` section 10, "interface fit"):

- **embedding vs. state.** ``encode(obs)`` produces an *observation
  embedding* -- for Dreamer's RSSM this is a token from the CNN/MLP encoder,
  *not* the full recurrent ``{deter, stoch}`` state (the embedding alone
  can't be rolled forward; it must be combined with the previous state and
  action via ``observe`` first). For TD-MPC2, whose latent has no separate
  recurrent carry, the embedding *is* numerically the state's only content
  (see ``LatentConsistencyModel``'s module docstring), but the two methods
  stay conceptually distinct so a Dreamer-style model can implement this
  base without the interface lying about what ``encode`` alone gives you.
- **``is_first``.** Every recurrent model (Dreamer's RSSM) needs a per-batch-
  element mask marking sequence starts so it zeroes the carried state at an
  episode boundary within a training window, instead of leaking the
  previous episode's dynamics across the seam. TD-MPC2 has no recurrent
  carry to reset (each ``observe`` call re-encodes from scratch, ignoring
  incoming state entirely), so it accepts and ignores this argument rather
  than dropping it from the shared signature.
- **``continue_`` returning ``None``.** A model with no learned continuation/
  termination head (``continue_`` returns ``None``) has no continuation
  signal at all coming out of ``rl_garden.world_models.imagine.imagine()``'s
  rollout -- that helper returns only ``states``/``actions`` (revised
  2026-09-14, see its own docstring) and has no termination-source parameter
  to inject one through. A caller that needs a continuation signal for such
  a model computes it itself from the returned ``states`` (e.g. a
  hand-written termination predicate, or a known fixed episode length); this
  base does not implement that itself, it only documents the contract
  ``continue_``'s ``None`` return leaves for the caller to fill. No concrete
  model in this repo currently exercises this path: TD-MPC2's non-episodic
  mode (the only ``continue_() -> None`` case here) never calls
  ``continue_`` at all (``TDMPC2.episodic``/``rl_garden.planners.mppi``),
  and DreamerV3's ``RSSM`` always has a continuation head.
