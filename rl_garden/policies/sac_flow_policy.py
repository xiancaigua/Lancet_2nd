"""SACPolicy variant with a FlowMatchingActor instead of a Gaussian actor.

Reuses SACPolicy's actor_extractor/critic/critic_target construction
unchanged; only the actor changes. SACPolicy.__init__ builds ``self.actor``
inline (no ``_build_actor()`` hook), so this subclass lets the parent build
its throwaway SquashedGaussianActor and immediately replaces it -- cheaper
than duplicating SACPolicy's critic-construction logic, and keeps
``sac_policy.py`` untouched.
