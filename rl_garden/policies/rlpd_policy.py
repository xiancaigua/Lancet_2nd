"""RLPD policy: SACPolicy with an optional pnorm ablation on actor/critic.

Builds via ``super().__init__()``, then replaces the modules that need
algorithm-specific construction, rather than adding ``use_pnorm`` params to
``SACPolicy.__init__`` itself --
``use_pnorm`` is an RLPD-specific ablation knob with no other caller, unlike
``dropout_rate``/``kernel_init``/``backbone_type`` which were already
generic ``SACPolicy`` capabilities before RLPD existed.
