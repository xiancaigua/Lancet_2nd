"""Thin ``nn.Module`` container for HILP's five sub-networks (``phi``-value,
its target, skill-value, skill-critic ensemble + target, skill-actor).

Not a ``BasePolicy`` -- that ABC's contract (actor/critic feature encoders
plus a `predict(obs, deterministic)` that maps *obs alone* to an action)
doesn't fit HILP's shape: there is no unified "policy" here, only networks
jointly consumed by ``HILP``'s own loss methods, and any action prediction
needs an extra ``skill`` argument ``BasePolicy.predict`` has no slot for. This class
exists only so ``BaseAlgorithm``'s existing ``self.policy.state_dict()``/
``.train()``/``.eval()`` machinery keeps working unmodified -- assigning each
network as a plain attribute already registers it as an ``nn.Module``
submodule, which is all ``state_dict()`` traversal needs.
