"""Flow-matching Behavioral Cloning policy with a shared feature extractor.

Actor-only, pure imitation learning: no critic, no distillation head, no
Q-guidance. Reuses ``ActorVectorField`` (``rl_garden/networks/actor_vector_field.py``)
directly -- the same network FQL's ``actor_bc_flow`` (``fql_policy.py``) already
is, minus everything else FQL adds on top. The BC-flow regression loss below
is the exact triplet from ``fql.py``'s actor update (``x_0``, continuous
``t``, ``x_t = (1-t)*x_0 + t*actions``, ``vel_target = actions - x_0``),
confirmed by direct comparison to be standard conditional (CondOT)
flow-matching regression, not an FQL-specific approximation.
