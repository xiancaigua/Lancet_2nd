"""Receding-horizon rollout wrapper for chunked (diffusion/flow) policies.

``DiffusionPolicy``.predict() (Dict obs) returns a full
``(B, horizon_steps, action_dim)`` chunk and leaves execution/slicing to the
caller (see those classes' own docstrings). This wraps one such policy to
expose the plain single-action ``BasePolicy.predict()`` contract instead:
sample a full chunk, execute the first ``n_action_steps`` actions from it one
at a time, then resample -- the same receding-horizon control pattern
``real-stanford/diffusion_policy``'s own ``predict_action`` uses (``start =
n_obs_steps - 1; end = start + n_action_steps``).
