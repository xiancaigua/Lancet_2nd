"""SPOT policy: TD3-BC's actor/critic plus a behavior-density VAE.

``SPOTPolicy`` extends ``TD3BCPolicy`` unmodified (actor/actor_target,
critic/critic_target, ``extract_features``, ``q_values_all``) and adds
``self.vae`` (a ``BehaviorVAE``), used by SPOT's actor loss as a "support
constraint" in place of TD3-BC's BC-MSE term.
