"""Uni-O4's deployed policy: greedy self-confidence selection over an ensemble.

Faithful port of ``AdaptiveBehaviorProximalPolicyOptimization
.mixed_offline_evaluate``'s greedy mode
(``3rd_party/Uni-O4/abppo.py``): at each state, every ensemble member
proposes its own deterministic action and scores that action under its own
distribution (a self-confidence/peakiness measure); the member with the
highest self-log-prob "wins" and its action is used. This is Uni-O4's own
deployed/inference policy, not any single ensemble member evaluated alone.

Not a ``BasePolicy`` -- that ABC's contract (one actor/critic feature encoder
pair owned directly by the policy) doesn't fit this shape: each ensemble
member is already its own ``BCPolicy``, with its own ``actor_extractor``, so
there is no single encoder for this wrapper to hold. It also has no
critic/value head of its own to route through ``extract_critic_features``
-- Uni-O4's shared V/Q critic lives on the ``UniO4`` algorithm object
(``BPPOCriticMixin``), never on any policy. Same reasoning as
``HILPPolicy``/``FlashSACPolicy`` (see ``rl_garden/policies/hilp_policy.py``).
